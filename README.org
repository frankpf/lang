* lang (name to be defined ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

tl;dr: I'm writing this programming language so that I can write my other programming language in this programming language

while working on the VM for [[https://github.com/frankpf/kiwi][Kiwi]], I decided that I didn't
like any existing programming language enough to use as the basis for implementing a VM.

so I decided to write a new language. then I'll rewrite kiwi using this language.

* pretty errors

uhh i've spent more time than i should on this feature

let's give the compiler [[./examples/test.kiwi][a file with some type errors]] as input:
#+begin_src kotlin
// line 1
// line 2
let a: Boolean = 50 >= "a"
let b: Integer = a
// line 5
// line 6
#+end_src

this is the output the compiler gives us:

* features I want

- statically-typed
- with type inference
- ADTs
- no GC
- generics ([[https://golang.org][lol imagine creating a language without generics and calling it modern]])
- will compile to native code, probably via C (at least in the beginning)
- macros maybe idk
